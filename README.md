‚îú‚îÄ Landing_page.html       # Entry point for the UI
‚îú‚îÄ Courses.html
‚îú‚îÄ home.html
‚îú‚îÄ question_page.html
‚îú‚îÄ login.html
‚îú‚îÄ signup_page.html
‚îú‚îÄ About_us/
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ about_us.html
‚îú‚îÄ assets/                 # Images, icons, etc.
‚îú‚îÄ css/                    # Stylesheets
‚îî‚îÄ js/                     # Frontend scripts
```

Note: Exact filenames/folders may vary slightly; use `Landing_page.html` as a starting point if browsing statically, or `app.py` if running the backend.
